<h2>Education &amp; Training</h2>
<p>I have a Master of Science in Clinical Rehabilitation Counseling from Portland State University, a dual-track program in Clinical Mental Health Counseling and Rehabilitation Counseling. As a Certified Rehabilitation Counselor (CRC), I have specific education, training, and experience in adjustment to disability and chronic illness.</p>
<p>In addition to being a National Certified Counselor (NCC) through the NBCC, I am an EMDR therapist and have received my training in Somatic Attachment EMDR therapy from the Personal Transformations Institute.</p>
<h3>Experience</h3>
<p>Prior to opening my private practice, I worked with adults and teens at both Health Allies Counseling and the Domestic Violence Resource Center providing individual and group counseling to survivors of domestic violence and narcissistic abuse and appreciate working with clients in all different walks of life and experiences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Throughout my work I acknowledge my priviledge and work to distmantle my own biases, learn from others and educate myself in a way that benefits all of my clients. I am dedicated to making my therapeutic practice a space where people of all intersecting identities are honored, validated and appreciated and where they feel they can openly express all of themselves. I do not discriminate on the basis of age, race/ethnicity, gender identity/expression, sexual orientation, relationship, socioeconomic status, mental or physical ability/disability, nation of orgin or religious beliefs or occupation.</p>
<p>While in my graduate program I offered counseling to clients at the PSU Community Counseling Clinic as well as worked as a Personal Support Worker with a six-year-old who is a non-traditional communicator. Our relationship relied on how I could read her non-verbal signals to communicate needs. This experience helped me to become attuned to verbal and non-verbal communication within the counseling room as well.</p>
<p>Before entering into graduate school I worked at Trillium Family Services in a psychiatric day treatment program classroom, providing emotional support, validation, and coping skills to a milieu of 13-15-year-olds who had experienced trauma. I had and have so much appreciation for these teen's creativity, resilience, and self-awareness and loved helping them learn more about navigating relationships with themselves and others in a healthy way no matter what they had been through.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Supervision and EMDR Consulting</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m a Registered Professional Counselor Associate (#R5893) with the Oregon Board of Licensed Professional Counselors and Therapists. This means I&rsquo;m working toward hours to become a Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC).</p>
<p>My Practice is Supervised by Kerri Anderson-Linde MS, LPC who has her own private practice and also teaches classes in counseling programs. I also seek monthly EMDR consultation from Jocelyn Fitzgerald, LPC. I am happy to share more about both what supervision and EMDR consultations can look like if you are interested.</p>
