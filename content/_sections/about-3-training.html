<h1>Education &amp; Training</h1>
<p>I have a Master of Science in Clinical Rehabilitation Counseling from Portland State University, a dual track program in Clinical Mental Health Counseling and Rehabilitation Counseling. As a Certified Rehabilitation Counselor (CRC), I have specific education, training, and experience in adjustment to disability and chronic illness.</p>
<p>In addition to being a National Certified Counselor (NCC) through the NBCC, I am an EMDR therapist and have received my training in Somatic Attachment EMDR therapy from the Personal Transformations Institute.</p>
<h4>Experience</h4>
<p>Prior to opening my private practice, I worked with adults, adolescents and children at the Domestic Violence Resource Center providing individual and group counseling to people who experienced intimate partner violence.</p>
<p>While in my graduate program I held a position of a Personal Support Worker with a 6 year old with varying disabilities. Prior to graduate school I worked at Trillium Family Services in a psychiatric day treatment program, I have also worked in residential settings and in schools.</p>
<h4>Supervision</h4>
<p>I&rsquo;m a Registered LPC Intern (#R5893) with the Oregon Board of Licensed Professional Counselors and Therapists. This means I&rsquo;m working toward hours to become a Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC).</p>
<p>My Practice is Supervised by Kerri Anderson-Linde MS, LPC who has her own private practice and also teaches classes in a counseling program. I am happy to share more about what the supervision process looks like if you have any questions.</p>
