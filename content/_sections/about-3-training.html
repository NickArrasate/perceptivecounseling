    <h1>Education & Training</h1>
      <p>I have a Master of Science in Clinical Rehabilitation Counseling from Portland State University, a dual track program in clinical mental health counseling and Rehabilitation counseling. As a Certified Rehabilitation Counselor (CRC), I have specific education, training, and experience in disability and chronic illness.
      </p><p>
          I’m also a National Certified Counselor (NCC) through the National Board for Certified Counselors. I also am a EMDR therapist and received my training in Somatic Attachment EMDR therapy from the Personal Transformations Institute. I have also completed a 40 hour Victims services training. 
      </p>
      <h4>Experience</h4>
      <p>Prior to opening my private practice, I worked with adults, adolescents and children at the Domestic Violence Resource Center providing individual and group counseling to people who experienced intimate partner violence.</p>
      <p>While in my graduate program I held a position of a Personal Support Worker with a 6 year old with varying disabilities. Prior to graduate school I worked at Trillium Family Services in a psychiatric day treatment program, I have also worked in residential settings and in schools.</p>
      <h4>Supervision</h4>
      <p>I’m a Registered LPC Intern (#R5893) with the Oregon Board of Licensed Professional Counselors and Therapists. This means I’m working toward hours to become a Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC).</p>
      <p>My Practice is Supervised by Kerri Anderson-Linde MS, LPC who holds her own private practice. I am happy to share more about what the supervision process looks like you have any questions.</p>
