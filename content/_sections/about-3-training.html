<h2>Education &amp; Training</h2>
<p>I have a Master of Science in Clinical Rehabilitation Counseling from Portland State University, a dual-track program in Clinical Mental Health Counseling and Rehabilitation Counseling. As a Certified Rehabilitation Counselor (CRC), I have specific education, training, and experience in adjustment to disability and chronic illness.</p>
<p>In addition to being a National Certified Counselor (NCC) through the NBCC, I am an EMDR therapist and have received my training in Somatic Attachment EMDR therapy from the Personal Transformations Institute.</p>
<h4>Experience</h4>
<p>Prior to opening my private practice, I worked with adults, adolescents, and children at the Domestic Violence Resource Center providing individual and group counseling to survivors of domestic violence.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-26a88625-7fff-e18e-1f2c-053582dc9c1c"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">While in my graduate program I offered counseling to clients at the PSU Community Counseling Clinic as well as worked as a Personal Support Worker with a six-year-old who is a non-traditional communicator. Our relationship relied on how I could read her non-verbal signals to communicate needs. This experience helped me to become attuned to verbal and non-verbal communication within the counseling room as well. </span></span></p>

I had and have so much appreciation for these teen's creativity, resilience, and self-awareness and loved helping them learn more about navigating relationships with themselves and others in a healthy way no matter what they had been through. </span></span></p>
<h4>Supervision</h4>
<p>I&rsquo;m a Registered Professional Counselor Associate (#R5893) with the Oregon Board of Licensed Professional Counselors and Therapists. This means I&rsquo;m working toward hours to become a Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC).</p>
<p>My Practice is Supervised by Kerri Anderson-Linde MS, LPC who has her own private practice and also teaches classes in a counseling program. I am happy to share more about what the supervision process looks like if you have any questions.</p>
