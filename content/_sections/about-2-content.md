<h3>Lucy Sherman, MS, NCC, CRC</h3>
<h4>Professional Counselor Associate, EMDR Therapist</h4>
<p>I am honored to collaborate together!</p>
<p>I love to bring creativity, imagination and humor into our work in a way that feels inviting to you! We have the opportunity to explore through drawing, writing, movement, visual cards and metaphors to tap into the incredible resources you already.</p>
<p>I have a gentle relational approach and always want to make sure that we are going at a pace that feels right for you. I bring guided visualization and mindful grounding exercises to deepen further body/mind connection and am trained in Somatic Attachment-Focused EMDR and have training in Expressive Arts for Trauma.</p>
<p>When I am not working with my wonderful clients, I enjoy painting, crafting and writing, connecting with close friends and partner and being in nature with my sweet Basset mix Penny.&nbsp;</p>
