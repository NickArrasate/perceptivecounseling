<h3>Lucy Sherman, MS, NCC, CRC</h3>
<h4>Professional Counselor Associate, EMDR Therapist</h4>
<p>I am honored to collaborate together and form a relationship where you can feel comfortable, seen and heard while sharing the parts of you that have been hidden, dismissed or overlooked.</p>
<p>I love to bring creativity into sessions in a way that feels inviting to you. We have the opportunity to explore through art, writing and metaphors to tap into the incredible resources you already have.</p>
<p> I also draw from mindfulness to deepen further body/mind connection and am trained in Somatic Attachment-Focused EMDR if you are interested in processing in that way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I am not working with my wonderful clients, I enjoy painting and crafting, connecting with close friends, being with my sweet dog and spending time in nature.&nbsp;</p>
