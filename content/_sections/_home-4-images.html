    <h2>Professional Status Monitoring for Shopify</h2>
    <p>Stop worrying about what you don’t know. ShopStatus monitors your Shopify site and sends you alerts when we detect trouble. If there's an outage you'll be the first to know, so you or your developer can resolve problems and get your shop back up and running – before losing sales or sending ad traffic to a broken site.</p>

    <h2>Total Coverage, Total Peace of Mind</h2>
    <p>We monitor your shopping cart, collections pages, and homepage by default. Add monitors for other critical pages, custom domains, apps, inventory levels, and even daily refund thresholds. When we detect a change that may jeopardize your business you'll receive an alert, along with updates when the status changes again.</p>

    <h2>Don't Lose Sales to Downtime</h2>
    <p>Most store owners don't realize outages when they occur. Problems happen, and they often cost sales or lead to public ridicule. Be proactive with 24/7 coverage and alerts. ShopStatus keeps you informed so you can focus on other aspects of your business – for the cost of a few cups of coffee per month.</p>
