<p><strong>Are you exhausted from hearing <em>&ldquo;you don&rsquo;t seem sick&rdquo;</em>, <em>&ldquo;well at least you don&rsquo;t...&rdquo;</em> or,<em> &ldquo;what is wrong with you&rdquo;?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>I am here to provide you with a space to share your real experience with disability and chronic illness and not the muted version of the story that you may tell others to make them feel more comfortable around you.</strong></p>
