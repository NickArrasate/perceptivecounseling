<p><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt; white-space: pre-wrap;">There can be grief around letting go of who you used to be, there can be fear of what life will look like now. </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt; white-space: pre-wrap;">Maybe sometimes life feels ok and other times you get up in the morning and feel in pain, lost, hopeless. In therapy together we can sit in the feelings and the pain that can be hard to share with others. </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt; white-space: pre-wrap;">We will collaborate together at the pace that feels right to you, there can be silence, there can be venting, there can be planning. We can celebrate your resilience while we hold a space for what was. </span></p>
<p>You will have 50 minutes out of your day for just you, for just your needs, whatever they might be for that day.&nbsp;</p>
