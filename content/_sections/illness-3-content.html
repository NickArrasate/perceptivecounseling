    <p>You will have 50 minutes out of your day for just you, for just your needs, whatever they might be for that day. </p>
    <p>For the past 10 years I have worked with people who identify as having a disability and/or chronic illness.</p>
    <p>From in-home direct care, residential programs, and schools, I have seen how adjustment to disability and chronic illness can bring up a spectrum of emotions and experiences.</p>
    <p>I have made it part of my lifeâ€™s work to be there for those emotions, to know the community resources that can be helpful and to be your advocate and support as you go through your process. </p>
