<p>There are moments where you think, &ldquo;Maybe that thing that I had to go through impacts how I am now, makes me more anxious than I need to be, maybe making it difficult for me to trust/open up/ feel secure/ feel happy/and inevitably affecting the way I live my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether one big incident of trauma or many small ones over time, what we experience and how we think and feel about it can influence the way we interact with ourselves and others.</p>
<p><strong>You may wonder, <em>"could there ever be a time where I won't be so sensitive to what happens around me and memories won&rsquo;t make me feel like I am living them all over again?&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
