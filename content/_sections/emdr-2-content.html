<p><strong>There are moments where you wonder, &ldquo;Maybe that thing that I experienced impacts how I am now, makes me more anxious than I need to be, maybe making it difficult for me to trust/open up/ feel secure/ feel happy/and inevitably affecting the way I live my life.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Whether one big incident of trauma or many small ones over time, what we experience and how we think and feel about it can influence the way we interact with ourselves and others.</strong></p>
