<p><strong>Every time you hear a loud noise, feel something, see something or smell something that reminds you of past memories your heart starts beating faster, you get tightness in your throat and you breathe heavier. Maybe you don't even know the memory but you have this felt sense that something is off and it may be effecting how well you sleep, your relationships and even your work.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You may wonder, <em>"could there ever be a time where I won't be so sensitive to what happens around me and memories won&rsquo;t make me feel like I am living them all over again?&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
