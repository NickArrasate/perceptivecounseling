<p>There are moments where you think, &ldquo;Maybe that thing that I had to go through impacts how I am now, makes me more anxious than I need to be, maybe making it difficult for me to trust/open up/ feel secure/ feel happy/and inevitably affecting the way I live my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether one big incident of trauma or many small ones over time, what we experience and how we think and feel about it can influence the way we interact with ourselves and with others.</p>
<p>EMDR can help by making some of those difficult memories and sensations less intense and less likely to impact you in the same way. Even though you will still know those memories happened, they may not carry as much power. There is a chance to create new beliefs and feelings about yourself that can move you toward living the life you are wanting to live while at the same time letting go of the messages&nbsp; about yourself that are not as helpful in your current experience.&nbsp;</p>
