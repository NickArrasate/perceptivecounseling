<p>Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is a form of trauma therapy. When we have a traumatic experience, our body and mind go into the natural fight flight freeze response. Sometimes if the event is traumatic enough, the memory can be stored with that same fight/flight/freeze response, therefore whenever there is a reminder of that memory, the body will be stuck reacting in the same way as if there is that traumatic thing taking place in the present. EMDR helps to remove the fight/flight freeze response using bilateral movement and essentially restores the memories in a way where they don't have the same charge. Many people will say after EMDR that they feel distant from that memory or that it doesn't bother them anymore the way it used to.</p>
