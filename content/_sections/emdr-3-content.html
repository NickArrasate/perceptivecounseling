<p>There are moments where you think, &ldquo;Maybe that thing that I had to go through impacts how I am now, makes me more anxious than I need to be, maybe making it difficult for me to trust/open up/ feel secure/ feel happy/and inevitably affecting the way I live my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether one big incident of trauma or many small ones over time, what we experience and how we think and feel about it can influence the way we interact with ourselves and with others. <span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; white-space: pre-wrap;">When we have a traumatic experience, our body and mind go into the natural fight, flight, freeze response. </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; white-space: pre-wrap;">Sometimes if the event is traumatic enough, the memory can be stored with that same flight fight freeze response, therefore whenever there is a reminder of that memory whether sound, feeling, smell, touch etc&hellip; the body will be stuck reacting in the same way as if there is that traumatic thing taking place. </span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; white-space: pre-wrap;">EMDR helps to remove the fight/ flight/ freeze response and essentially restores the memories in a way where they don&rsquo;t have that same charge. Many people will say that they are distant from that memory, or it doesn&rsquo;t affect them the way it used to. </span></p>
