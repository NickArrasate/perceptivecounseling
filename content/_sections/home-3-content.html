<p>You might feel sadness and confusion, you might have recurring memories that seem to impact your relationships with yourself and others.</p>
<p>Maybe you are busy during the day but at night when you are alone with your thoughts and feelings, your mind starts racing to all the things that feel off in life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You might feel that it is time to seek another perspective, some extra support in helping you connect with the person you want to be in the life that you want.</p>
<p>I strive to create a collaborative and safe environment in therapy where you feel accepted, appreciated, encouraged, and understood. I also hold a space to explore difficult thoughts and emotions that may be hard to explore alone.</p>
<p>I offer warmth, empathy and compassion for where you are right now while also facilitating collaborative dialogue to explore how you want to grow.</p>
