<h3>Lucy Sherman, MS, NCC, CRC, Professional Counselor Associate, EMDR Therapist</h3>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">I am honored to collaborate together and form a relationship where you can feel comfortable, seen and heard while sharing the parts of you that have been hidden, dismissed or overlooked.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #403027; font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">I love to bring creativity into sessions in a way that feels inviting to you. We have the opportunity to explore through art, writing and metaphors to tap into the incredible resources you already have. I also draw from mindfulness to deepen further body/mind connection and am trained in Somatic Attachment-Focused EMDR if you are interested in processing in that way.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">When I am not working with my wonderful clients, I enjoy painting and crafting, connecting with close friends, being with my sweet dog and spending time in nature.&nbsp;</span></p>
