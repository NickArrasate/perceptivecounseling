<h3>Lucy Sherman, MS, NCC, CRC, LPC Intern</h3>
<p>It is with great joy that I get to bring authenticity, empathy, curiosity, presence, humor, and creativity into the counseling room.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #7b84a2; font-family: Ubuntu, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">I am passionate about working with adults and teens from a non-judgmental framework where you are the expert on your own life. I am honored to collaborate together and form a relationship where you can feel comfortable, seen and heard while sharing the parts of you that have been hidden, dismissed or overlooked. I want to appreciate and validate your strengths and hone in on how you can be the you that you want to be in the life that you hope for.</span><span style="color: #403027; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 15px;"> When I am not working with my wonderful clients, I enjoy painting and crafting, connecting with close friends, watching reruns of the office, listening to live music and taking walks in nature whenever possible.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #7b84a2; font-family: Ubuntu, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
