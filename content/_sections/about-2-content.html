      <p>
        I am honored to help you explore the changes you want in your life as you hone in on how you can gain more self compassion and empowerment.
      </p><p>
        It is with great joy that I get to bring authenticity, empathy, curiosity, presence and humor into the counseling room.
      </p><p>
        Our therapeutic alliance is one of the most crucial elements for creating the positive changes you want in your life, therefore finding the right fit is key.
      </p><p>
        I believe that every person has the capacity to foster self-compassion and self-healing. Therapy offers a space for you to gain insight into how you can support all of who you are. 
      </p><p>
        As a somatic-attachment focused EMDR therapist, I work with you to delve into how your experiences, memories, and ways you have learned to adapt impact your life and affect your current relationship with yourself and others. 
      </p><p>
        As a Clinical Rehabilitation Counselor with a speciality in adjustment to disability and chronic illness, I understand how both physical and emotional experiences can influence the way we live our lives and how we see ourselves. I work holistically to honor your physiological and emotional responses to stress.
      </p><p>
        I consider nonverbal communication to be just as valuable as verbal communication, therefore I draw from both nonverbal and verbal communication within the therapy room.
