<h3>Lucy Sherman, MS, NCC, CRC, LPC Intern, EMDR Therapist</h3>
<p>I am honored to collaborate together and form a relationship where you can feel comfortable, seen and heard while sharing the parts of you that have been hidden, dismissed or overlooked.</p>
<p><span style="color: #403027; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 15px;">I love to bring creativity into sessions by exploring emotion through art, writing and connecting themes with metaphors to tap into the incredible resources you already have. I also draw from mindfulness to deepen further body/mind connection and self-compassion and am trained in Somatic Attachment-Focused EMDR if you are wanting to process in that way.</span></p>
<p>When I am not working with my wonderful clients, I enjoy painting and crafting, connecting with close friends, listening to live music and being in nature.&nbsp;</p>
