<div class="d-flex align-items-center justify-content-around row">
<div class="col-sm-10 col-md-8 col-lg-6">
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Both<strong> you</strong> <strong>teen</strong> and<strong> you</strong> parent are working to figure out the new balance,<strong> you</strong> parent are hoping your teen is safe, learning tools that can help them navigate healthy and unhealthy relationships in their life. <strong>You</strong> parent want the best for your teen, you have worked up until this point to make sure they are with the right people doing the right thing. You teen are wanting to make decisions on your own, have some autonomy and be trusted. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"><strong>You teen are amazing!</strong> you are learning, growing, you are tackling so much all at once not just to mention your schedule. All these new friendships, new relationships, new understanding about how strange this world is, trying to take it all in and yet look like you know exactly what you are doing. You notice more and more that you are closing up, worried about what others think of you, what they will say, what happens if you say something and it is wrong or seems stupid. You want to be trusted and yet supported, you want to be seen and yet also able to dissapear if needed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">You want to be strong and share how you feel about things like you used to but it gets harder and harder to feel confident and happy doing so. You remember feeling happy in the past but now it is more difficult by the day and you keep catching yourself being unkind to yourself. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt; white-space: pre-wrap;">I am here to create a place for you to figure out how to keep your sense of self even when everything is whirling around. I want to support you where you are right now, collaborate with you and validate what you are going through because it is truly difficult. </span></p>
