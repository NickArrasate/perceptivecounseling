<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Both<strong> you</strong> parent and<strong> you</strong> teen are working to figure out the new balance,<strong> you</strong> parent are hoping your teen is safe, learning tools that can help them navigate healthy relationships in their life. <strong>You</strong> parent want the best for your teen, you have worked up until this point to make sure they are with the right people doing the right thing. Now there is this weird middle ground of them growing, moving into making big decisions on their own without your help, navigating new relationships without you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">You as a parent don't want to smother them and yet you are worried that others might do something that will impact their life for the worst.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"><strong>You teen are amazing!</strong> you are learning, growing, you are tackling so much all at once not just to mention your schedule. All these new friendships, new relationships, new understanding about how strange this world is, trying to take it all in and yet look like you know what you are doing. You notice more and more that you are closing up, worried about what others think of you, what they will say, what happens if you say something and it is wrong or seems stupid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">You want to be strong and share how you feel about things like you used to but it gets harder and harder to feel confident and happy doing so. You are maybe trying to avoid some of the stuff that is harder these days. </span></p>

I want to support you where you are right now, collaborate with you and validate what you are going through. </span></p>
