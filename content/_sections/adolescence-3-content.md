<h3>A Space All Your Own</h3>
<p>This is a strange time and I want to offer a space where you can share all of what you are experiencing unfiltered.</p>
<p>I want to help you as you are working toward saying what you need, as you are coping with the state of the world, as you are gaining more autonomy, setting boundaries and trusting your intuition.</p>
<p>You can have a place in your week to connect with yourself and I will meet you wherever you are. Our work together can look different as things shift in your life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may have sessions of more needing to verbal release/vent, others that are more quiet and reflective or building on tools to stay grounded while things are whirling around. We can use drawing, writing, music all as a way to process what you are going through.&nbsp;</p>
