<h2>Welcome&nbsp;</h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>I appreciate you being here!</strong></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">You are craving a space that is fully yours to process what you are going through and what you have gone through so you can feel some relief in the present.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>&nbsp;Do you resonate?&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are feeling like you are not enough and are wondering if there is something deeper underneath that is affecting you and the way you feel about yourself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You feel indecisive and want to trust yourself more so you can make decisions that are not based only on what you feel others want of you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You wonder if you are as competent as others in your position and feel anxious in situations where you need to express yourself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You often wonder if you are doing something wrong or bad and if you will be judged.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have always been highly sensitive and feel impacted by other's energy. Lately everything has been feeling overstimulating and overwhelming and you want to feel more grounded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have had experiences with health care professionals that have been invalidating and so you worry that therapy will be invalidating too though you know you need a little extra support.&nbsp;</p>
