title: "Who is ShopStatus meant for?"
---
ShopStatus was built to alert store owners or managers of outages and downtime that can lead to lost sales.

It monitors your Shop's pages, domains, apps, and inventory, and alerts you if there is a concern.

We believe <em>everyone</em> making digital sales should use ShopStatus to minimize the losses caused by unplanned interruptions in their sales flows.
