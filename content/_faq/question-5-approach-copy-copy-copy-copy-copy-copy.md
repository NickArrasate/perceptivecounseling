Also unique to you! I want to meet you where you are at and will check in to see how the process is going for you.

<li>Compassion-Focused Therapy</li>
<li>Attachment-Focused Therapy</li>
<li>Person-Centered Therapy</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Some of the tools I use to deepen self-compassion and understanding:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mindfulness exercises and Grounding exercises</li>
<li>Exploration through Art</li>
<li>Exploration through writing</li>
<li>Exploration through inner dialogue</li>
<li>Exploring feelings toward past self</li>
<li>Exploration of attachment patterns in the room</li>
<li>Exploration of what body is communicating</li>
<li>EMDR resourcing</li>
<li>Exploring how the brain and body are impacted by trauma</li>
