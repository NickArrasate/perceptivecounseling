<ul>
<li>There is a waiting area, I will come greet you at time of appointment and show you to the office.</li>
<li>The beginning of our session will be re-iterating some of the key points from the paperwork and I can answer any questions you may have.</li>
<li>From there I will usually offer some grounding exercise and then together we can explore where we want to start, everyone is different so I always want to make sure that where we start feels ok.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
