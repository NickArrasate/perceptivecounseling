<ul>
<li>I will invite you into the office space&nbsp;</li>
<li>The beginning of our session we will go over the basics about practice policy and then the rest of the session is about getting to connect further, gaining some context for what you are experiencing while building a tool kit. I may share invitations for creative ways to explore in new ways to support you as well.&nbsp;</li>
