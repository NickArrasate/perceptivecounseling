<ul>
<li>You arrive to address 325 NW 21st ave. and use the key code (Sent in the initial welcome email).</li>
<li>The staircase will be in front of you, my office is on the left (Ste. 102) and the bathrooms are on the right of the stairs. There is a waiting area to the left of the stairs and you are welcome to wait there until I come out and greet you.</li>
<li>I will welcome you into the office and offer you tea and a chance to get settled :)</li>
<li>The beginning of our session will be re-iterating some of the key points from the paperwork, I can share a bit more about the way I work and my ethical responsibilities and you are always welcome to ask any questions you have.</li>
<li>From there we get to start wherever you like as we continue to have more of a sense of each other in the room together.</li>
</ul>
