After installing the app and setting up an account (<a href="/getting-started/">see the Docs</a>), ShopStatus will monitor products, sales channels, and installed Apps and alert you when there are outages. ShopStatus will also monitor the health of the Shopify Platform itself and alert you to the occurrence and nature of outages.


You can customize the frequency of alerts and specific which channels to be monitored from your dashboard.
