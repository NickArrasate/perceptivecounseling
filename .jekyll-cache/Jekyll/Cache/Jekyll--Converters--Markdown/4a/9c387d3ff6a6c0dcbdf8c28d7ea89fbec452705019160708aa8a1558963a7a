You are navigating all these new friendships, new relationships, new understanding about how strange this world is, trying to take it all in and look like you know exactly what you are doing. You may notice more and more that you are closing up, worried about what others think of you, what they will say and what happens if you say something and it is wrong or seems stupid. </span></p>

You may remember feeling happy in the past but now it is more difficult by the day and you keep catching yourself bullying yourself. </span></p>

I am honored&nbsp; for the opportunity to work with you as we both gain new insights, question in new ways and learn more resources to support all of who you are and who you want to be.&nbsp;</p>
