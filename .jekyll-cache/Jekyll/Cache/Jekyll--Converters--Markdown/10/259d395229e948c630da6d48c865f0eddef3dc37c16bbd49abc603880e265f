I"<p>We can decide the best option that works for you during our first session</p>
<p>There are several options that are in person:</p>
<p>Square card reader, cash and check that I ask for at the beginning of the session.</p>
<p>You can also sign into Simple Practice and charge your card by the beginning of our session.</p>
<p>You are also welcome to ask me to set up an automatic payment on the secure Simple Practice client portal which charges the evening after scheduled sessions and can be paused at any time.</p>
