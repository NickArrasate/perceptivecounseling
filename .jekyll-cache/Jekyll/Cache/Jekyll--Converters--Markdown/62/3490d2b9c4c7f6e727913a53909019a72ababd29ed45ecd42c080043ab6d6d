<p><strong>Every time you hear a loud noise, feel something, see something or smell something that reminds you of past memories your heart starts beating faster, you get tightness in your throat and you breathe heavier. Maybe you don't even know the memory but you have this felt sense that something is off and it may be effecting how well you sleep, your relationships and even your work.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You may wonder, <em>"could there ever be a time where I won't be so sensitive to what happens around me and memories won&rsquo;t make me feel like I am living them all over again?&rdquo;</em></strong></p>

<p>There are moments where you think, &ldquo;Maybe that thing that I had to go through impacts how I am now, makes me more anxious than I need to be, maybe making it difficult for me to trust/open up/ feel secure/ feel happy/and inevitably affecting the way I live my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether one big incident of trauma or many small ones over time, what we experience and how we think and feel about it can influence the way we interact with ourselves and others.</p>
<p>Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is a form of trauma therapy. When we have a traumatic experience, our body and mind go into the natural fight flight freeze response. Sometimes if the event is traumatic enough, the memory can be stored with that same fight/flight/freeze response, therefore whenever there is a reminder of that memory, the body will be stuck reacting in the same way as if there is that traumatic thing taking place in the present. EMDR helps to remove the fight/flight freeze response using bilateral movement and essentially restores the memories in a way where they don't have the same charge. Many people will say after EMDR that they feel distant from that memory or that it doesn't bother them anymore the way it used to.</p>

Deborah Kennard who trained under Francine Shapiro the founder of EMDR realized there were some ways to make the EMDR process within the room feel more comfortable, safe and mindful and the therapist more aware, relational and empathetic.</span></p>
