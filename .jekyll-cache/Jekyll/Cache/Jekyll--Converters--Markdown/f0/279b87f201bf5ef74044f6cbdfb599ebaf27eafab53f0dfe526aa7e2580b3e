I"·<p>This is a chance for us to get a little sense of each other before we have an in-person appointment. You get to ask anything your heart desires about the counseling process, the way I work, etc. And if you donâ€™t have questions, that is a-ok, too.</p>

<p>We also get to cover some logistics and I get to ask a few questions around safety and making sure that individual counseling one time per week seems like an appropriate fit.</p>
