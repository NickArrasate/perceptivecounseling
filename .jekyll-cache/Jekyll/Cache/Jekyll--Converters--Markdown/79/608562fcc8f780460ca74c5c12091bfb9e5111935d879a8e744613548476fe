I"e<p>Pretty standard, if you cancel before 24 hours then there is no fee. If you cancel under 24 hours there is a fee.</p>
<p>Exception: If the cancelation is due to inclement weather that is out of your control there is no fee.</p>
<p>If I have availability in my schedule I will often try to work with you to reschedule within the same week you missed.</p>
